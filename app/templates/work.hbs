  <h1>Work experience</h1>

  <h2>ActBlue Technical Services (2020-present)</h2>
  <p>
    I develop the fundraising tools that help power progressive nonprofits,
    political campaigns, and more. Those tools are used by thousands of
    organizations. My day-to-day work is in React and Rails. I specialize in
    writing maintainable, testable, accessible UIs.
  </p>

  <h2>Ember Learning Core Team (2017-present)</h2>
  <p>
    This is a volunteer leadership position that I do in my free time. I help
    guide the direction, content, and infrastructure of learning resources for
    Ember.js, an open source front end framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Cardstack (2019-2020)</h2>
  <p>
    I was focused on developing a new CMS platform that allows non-developers
    to create their own web apps. I worked on framework code, tutorials, and new video content.
  </p>

  <h2>BioBright (2016-2019)</h2>
  <p>
    I helped lead, design, and code applications that advance scientific
    research. Projects included voice controlled AI, voice transcription,
    natural language processing, interactive data visualization, full stack web
    apps, and desktop software.
  </p>

  <h2>Next Step Living (2012-2016)</h2>
  <p>
    As a corporate trainer, I was responsible for working with business analysts
    and the division VP to improve operations, customer service, and sales
    results at a company focused on sustainability and mitigating climate
    change. In earlier roles, I managed a team of 12 outreach staff.
